#Upload data file(s) 
#Choose data mode by number of detectors (1, 2, 3) 
#Choose experiment: magnetic field, altitude, time of day, etc.
#View file dropdown shows first and last 5 rows
#Have buttons to show means, modes, medians of variable data (e.g. avg sipm energy)
#Raw graphs if 1 scintillator: 
    #Rate vs calculated SiPM peak voltage line graph, also 3 lines from 3 diff scintillators
    #Coincidence graph: Count rate vs time line graph, also 3 lines from 3 diff scintillators
    #Number of signals by timestamp histogram if time of day experiment
#Coincidence data filtering 
#Graph of coincident measurements

#For magnetic field experiment, filter out coincidence measurements from both data files and graph them side-by-side
